# Logging with the AMDC
Logging variables of interest is a critical feature needed for debugging and testing of new code. Because of this, the AMDC has logging 
capabilities built into the firmware. The intent of this document is to show a user how to implement logging in their code. 

There are two interfaces that can be used for logging: 1) the standard serial terminal interface that is typically used with user commands (logging can be thought of as an application that can be included in your project) and 2) a Python interface that is built on top of and wraps the serial interface. It is highly recommended that users use the Python interface as it provides certain convenience methods and abstractions that make logging much more intuitive and less error prone.
